# ELT-Docker-Airflow

This repository houses an ELT pipeline encapsulated within Docker containers. It is engineered to extract data from a source Postgres database, transfer it seamlessly to a destination Postgres database, and subsequently execute transformations using a DBT model within the destination database. Additionally, the repository includes integration capabilities for scheduling CRON jobs, and the entire pipeline is automated through Airflow.
