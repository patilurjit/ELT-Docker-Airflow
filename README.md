# ELT-Docker-Airflow

This repository houses an ELT pipeline designed to extract data from a source Postgres database, seamlessly transfer it to a destination Postgres database, and subsequently execute transformations on the data within the destination database utilizing a DBT model. Additionally, the repository features integration capabilities for scheduling CRON jobs, and the entire pipeline is automated through Airflow.
